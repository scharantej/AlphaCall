## Design of Flask Application for ml day trading us stocks - long strategy

### Introduction
We aim to delve into the world of machine learning (ML) and stock trading by creating a Python Flask application that uses ML to make long trading decisions on US stocks. This application will allow users to interact with the ML model, visualize data, and make informed trades.

### Application Structure
The application will consist of the following components:

- **HTML Files:**
  - `index.html`: The homepage, serving as the application's entry point, will provide an overview of the application's capabilities and instructions for usage.
  - `dashboard.html`: The dashboard page, the main user interface, will allow users to interact with the ML model and visualize data.

- **Python Scripts:**
  - `app.py`: The main Flask application file, responsible for routing and handling user interactions.
  - `ml_model.py`: The ML model, containing the logic for making trading decisions, will be stored in a separate file for clarity.

### Routes
The application will have the following routes:

- `/`: The root route, which will render the `index.html` page.
- `/dashboard`: The dashboard route, which will render the `dashboard.html` page.
- `/predict`: An API route that accepts stock data and returns the ML model's prediction for that data, helping users make trading decisions.

### Implementation Details
- The `index.html` page will provide an overview of the application, including instructions on how to use it and a link to the dashboard.
- The `dashboard.html` page will feature a form for users to enter stock information, as well as interactive visualizations to display data and predictions.
- The `/predict` route will use the ML model to make predictions based on the user-entered data. The predictions will be displayed on the dashboard.
- The ML model stored in `ml_model.py` will be trained on historical stock data, enabling it to make accurate predictions on future market movements.

### Conclusion
This Flask application will serve as a valuable tool for individuals interested in using ML for long-term trading strategies in US stocks. It will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the ML model, allowing users to make informed trading decisions with ease.
